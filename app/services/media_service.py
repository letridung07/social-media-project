# Example of how to potentially initialize and use (not part of the class itself):
# [This section has been cleaned up to remove problematic syntax]
#
# The following comments provide context on how this service might be used
# within a Flask application.

# To make current_app available for the __init__ method when this module is loaded,
# it must be within a Flask application context or mocked.
# For actual usage within Flask, current_app will be available if the service
# is instantiated or its methods are called within a request context or app context.
# The __init__ using current_app.config is fine for that.

# In a real Flask app, you might register this service with the app or use dependency injection.
# For this project, we will likely instantiate it in the routes.py or import its instance.

# A global instance could be created if configuration is static after app setup,
# but that can be tricky with current_app availability at import time.
# Instantiating on demand or passing app/config is generally safer.

# Consider if this service should be a singleton or instantiated per request/use.
# Given its nature (external interaction), a singleton configured at app start might be suitable.
# For simplicity, direct instantiation in route functions is a valid approach.
# If instantiation becomes repetitive, refactor to a shared instance (e.g., on app object or g).

# A factory function like get_media_service (using Flask's `g` object for per-request singleton)
# is also a common pattern.

# The service methods primarily log, so multiple instances are not inherently harmful.
# The config access in __init__ is the main part needing `current_app`.
# Using `current_app.config` is flexible.
# The module-level logger `logging.getLogger(__name__)` is standard.
# `current_app.logger` could also be used if calls are within an app context.
# Stick with `logging.getLogger(__name__)` for service-specific logs.
# The `__init__` using `current_app.config` implies instantiation must happen
# when `current_app` is available (e.g., inside a request context).

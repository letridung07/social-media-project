# This file is slated for deletion.
# All its original contents (Expression, Constant, Variable, Operations, _get_linear_coeffs, _factorial)
# have been moved to:
# - app.libs.pymath.symbolic.core (Expression, Constant, Variable, _factorial)
# - app.libs.pymath.symbolic.operations (all BinaryOperation and UnaryOperation subclasses)
# - app.libs.pymath.symbolic.algebra (_get_linear_coeffs)
#
# Original imports that were in this file:
# import math
# from collections import defaultdict
# from typing import Union, Tuple # Tuple was used by _get_linear_coeffs
#
# This file should no longer be imported directly by other modules for these classes/functions.
# Instead, import from the new locations.
pass
# Adding 'pass' to make it a valid Python module if it's checked.
